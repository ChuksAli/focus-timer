What is a pomodoro timer?

A timer that counts down from 25mins to zero, when it reaches zero there is a 5min break
there are generally 4 cycles of this and then there is a 45 minute break
I would like to be able to choose number of cycles eventually
A sound need to be played when zero is reached to signal next phase of the cycles
A pause button should be available
